# Deep-Learning-Course-Projects

This repository contains the projects I've done in Udacity's Deep Learning program.

1. CNN Project: use VGG16 to train a new CNN model to forecast the landmark of any pictures through transfer learning, achieved an accuracy of ~75%
2. RNN Project: build a LSTM to generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data
3. GAN Project: build and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces and get a generator network to generate new images of faces
